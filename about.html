         Is it any surprise that Chef Manish Mehrotra’s Inaayat occupies the Number One slot on the list of India’s top 50 restaurants? From the drinks to the desserts, Chef Mehrotra’s reinterpretation of nostalgic Indian dishes using global cues has inspired an entire generation of Indian chefs to innovate. Think marigold cocktail (with dark rum, fresh lime, cranberry and orange juice), meetha achaar pork spare ribs that come with sundried mango and pickled kohlrabi and literally fall off the bone, and tandoori bacon prawns with wasabi malai. The restaurant recently renovated, the interiors include three private dining rooms and stunning photographs of the city’s medieval monuments and the beautiful Lodhi Gardens. With a branch soon in New York and London, his inventive restaurant is earning critical acclaim globally, making sure the rest of the world develops an Indian accent.
   Chef Mehrotra prefers to use fresh, seasonal and local produce wherever possible and often travels to small towns and villages to source his ingredients. In fact, a family in Kolhapur even makes some specialised masalas for the restaurant. Indian Accent also receives fresh, organically grown root vegetables and micro greens from farmers around the country and mostly use cold-pressed mustard oil, house-made ghee and fresh coconut oil in its cooking.
